Alright, alright.

So I was walking down Lewis Street, right?

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Talk>>
And you know how Lewis Street is, it’s a wild show of hobos and rats, right?

It actually is a disgrace to the city, no joke.

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Talk>>
Honestly, someone should just go down there and SWOOSH!

<<PlayEffect Dicky_Obj Sway>>
<<Punchline Dicky>>
Just clean the streets, you know what I’m saying? Haha!

Anyway, do you know what Lewis Street was called before it was called Lewis Street?


Crack Street!

Take a guess at why the city decided to name a street Crack Street.

No, no, get your head out of the gutter. Not that!

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Talk>>
C’mon now, have some faith! Haha!

<<PlayEffect Dicky_Obj Sway>>
<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Talk>>
<<Punchline Dicky>>
It was cuz every time you walk down that street, you only saw the buttcracks of hobos!

Honestly, honestly, it’s clear that the street was always a problem right?

It’s honestly a shame they put the best spaghetti place in the city on Crack Street.

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Talk>>
You ever been there? It’s a place called Slice n’ Dice.

It’s an odd name, I admit, I admit.

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Idle>>
But honest to God. I’ve never seen a meat delivery truck go to that pizza place.

<<PlayEffect Dicky_Obj Sway>>
<<Punchline Dicky>>
I guess we know where Slice n’ Dice is collecting their meatballs, huh? Haha!
