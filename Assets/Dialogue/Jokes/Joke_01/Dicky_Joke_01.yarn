Dicky: Alright, alright.

Dicky: So I was walking down Lewis Street, right?

Dicky: And you know how Lewis Street is, it’s a wild show of hobos and rats, right?

<<ChangeSprite Dicky_Obj Mad>>
Dicky: It actually is a disgrace to the city, no joke.

<<Punchline Dicky>>
Dicky: Just clean the streets, you know what I’m saying? Haha!

Dicky: Anyway, do you know what Lewis Street was called before it was called Lewis Street?

Dicky: Crack Street!

Dicky: Take a guess at why the city decided to name a street Crack Street.

<<Punchline Dicky>>
Dicky: No, no, get your head out of the gutter. Not that!

Dicky: C’mon now, have some faith! Haha!

<<Punchline Dicky>>
Dicky: It was cuz every time you walk down that street, you only saw the buttcracks of hobos!

Dicky: Honestly, honestly, it’s clear that the street was always a problem right?

Dicky: It’s honestly a shame they put the best spaghetti place in the city on Crack Street.

Dicky: You ever been there? It’s a place called Slice n’ Dice.

Dicky: It’s an odd name, I admit, I admit.

Dicky: But honest to God. I’ve never seen a meat delivery truck go to that pizza place.

<<Punchline Dicky>>
Dicky: I guess we know where Slice n’ Dice is collecting their meatballs, huh? Haha!

<<Punchline Dicky>>
Dicky: Looks like someone got to cleaning the streets, huh? Haha!
